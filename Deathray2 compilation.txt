Deathray compilation
====================

The project works with VS2012 Express Edition. Newer versions should 
convert the project without any issues.

The AMD OCL Light SDK 3 was used to make the project and the project's 
properties are based upon the environment variable OCL_ROOT. See:

https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/OCL-SDK

The installer should create the required environment variable OCL_ROOT.

For other SDKs you will need to supply the appropriate paths in:

C++ 
---

Additional Include Directories, option /I


Linker
------

Additional Dependencies

If in doubt examine these settings from a sample project that was installed
as part of the SDK that you are using.


Note on Compilation of OpenCL Kernels
=====================================

The text of the OpenCL kernels is found in project files whose extension is
.CL. These files are "compiled" by Visual Studio into the DLL as resources.

Any changes to the code in these source files requires that Visual Studio
re-compiles the resources. This consists of right-clicking on Deathray.rc
and choosing the option "Compile".

The resources then need to be linked into the DLL, so link Deathray.
